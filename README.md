The dificulties according to me where all the items and properties where given in object structure so I was not able to easily map, so I convertedinto array and I just mapped with index of the object elements and for the total calculation part, I just got scrambled up in useReducer partand somehow I managed to make the changes in SingleProductPage js file and yet it was much competitive for me to work. If there was a quantity  array like quantity:1,would have been better to easily map the quantity for each options of 4k,1080p and battery, so that made me to take a long time to work and I  made the functionality to work in direct component.The reviews get map once when you keep on refreshing the task page. I added some extra product info in order to make some changes and make much more attractive to look I learned how to use timer from youtube videos and implemented it.Login and logout functions are activated import the task page. The task page is been provided with a PrivateRoute, so do not forget to check it

So the project can run with "npm run" successfully 
There are totally 5 pages Product Page,ErrorPage,SignIn Page About Page and Task Page,
The task page can be accessed only when you login with Auth0


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
