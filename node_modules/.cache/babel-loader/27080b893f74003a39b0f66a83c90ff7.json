The dificulties according to me where all the items and properties where given in object so I was not able to easily map, so I converted into array and I just mapped with index of the object elements and for the total calculation part, I just got scrambled up in useReducer part and somehow I managed to make the changes in SingleProductPage.js and yet it was much competitive for me to work.
