The dificulties according to me where all the items and properties where given in object structure so I was not able to easily map, so I converted into array and I just mapped with index of the object elements and for the total calculation part, I just got scrambled up in useReducer part and somehow I managed to make the changes in SingleProductPage.js and yet it was much competitive for me to work. If there was a quantity  array like quantity:1, import PropTypes from 'prop-types' would have been better to easily map the quantity for each options of 4k,1080p and battery, so that made me to take a long time to work and I made the functionality to work in direcet component. According to my knowledge I purely prefer to work on function part first and then the design part, to be honest I completed the components and functional part by wednesday and I was making some alterations and some console logs. I get many much issues while working on styles but even those styles would give a different and attractive look and I hope I was able to satisfy the technical part.
